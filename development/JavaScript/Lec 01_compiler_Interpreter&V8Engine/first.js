// diff between inerpreter and compiler 

/*
Compiler - convert source code into machine code at once, compiler identify all errors after all initial translation.

Interprator- convert source code into machine code line by line , it stops at first error they find which is easier for debug.


V8 Engine- available in chrome browser which is use for compline and execute JS code  , which is help us to run source code inside the browser.

if we need to run JS code outside the browser we need to insall a compiler for it, so need to be install node seperately in the machine. 


/// to check is node install in our machine use the command node --v  in terminal
